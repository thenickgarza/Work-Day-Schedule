WORK DAY SCHEDULER!!

This projects focus was to build a "Work Day Scheduler" using moment js, jQuery, and bootstrap. You are able to save tasks according the needed time and the lists will be green or red. Green being that the time is comming up and red being the current time. When you input somehthing in the text box for a certain time and click the save icon on the far right side of its container it will save to your local storage so feel free to close the webpage! Your tasks will still be there! Provided below is a live link!!!
